# Module 2: Autoscaling

## Overview

Your Voting App has smart scheduling from Module 1, but every service still runs exactly one replica. What happens during a flash sale when thousands of votes pour in? Static replicas cannot handle traffic spikes. Manual scaling with `kubectl scale` is reactive, not proactive. You need autoscaling to make the app self-adjusting.

This module teaches horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) with Metrics Server, vertical pod autoscaling (VPA) recommendations, and event-driven scaling with KEDA. You will configure vote and result services to auto-scale on CPU, then explore scaling the worker based on Redis queue depth.

## What You Will Learn

- Install and verify Metrics Server in your KIND cluster
- Configure HPA with CPU targets for vote and result services
- Generate load and observe autoscaling in real-time
- Understand VPA recommendations for right-sizing resource requests
- Set up KEDA for event-driven worker scaling based on Redis queue length

## Prerequisites

- Module 0 and Module 1 completed
- KIND cluster running with 3 worker nodes
- Example Voting App deployed with scheduling rules from Module 1
- Basic understanding of resource requests and limits
