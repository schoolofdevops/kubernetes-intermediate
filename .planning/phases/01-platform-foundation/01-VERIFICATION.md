### Anti-Patterns Found

**None.** All artifacts are substantive and properly wired.

**Checked for:**
- TODO/FIXME/placeholder comments in docusaurus.config.ts: None found
- Empty implementations: None found
- Stub patterns: None found
- All configuration files are complete and functional

### Human Verification Required

The following items require human verification as they involve visual appearance, user experience, and interactive behavior that cannot be fully verified programmatically:

#### 1. Dark Mode Visual Quality

**Test:** Open https://schoolofdevops.github.io/kubernetes-intermediate/ in browser, toggle dark mode
**Expected:** 
- Theme switches smoothly between light and dark
- Colors remain readable in both modes
- Refresh page - theme preference persists via localStorage
**Why human:** Visual quality assessment and interaction testing

#### 2. Code Block Copy Functionality

**Test:** Navigate to any module overview page, hover over a code block
**Expected:**
- Copy button appears on hover
- Clicking copy button copies code to clipboard
- Visual feedback confirms copy action
**Why human:** Interactive behavior and clipboard testing

#### 3. Responsive Design on Mobile

**Test:** Open site in browser DevTools device mode, test various mobile widths
**Expected:**
- Hamburger menu appears and functions at mobile width
- Sidebar becomes slide-out drawer
- Content remains readable without horizontal scroll
- Code blocks scroll horizontally if needed
**Why human:** Visual layout verification across multiple screen sizes

#### 4. Navigation Flow

**Test:** Click through modules using Next/Previous buttons and sidebar links
**Expected:**
- Sequential navigation works correctly
- Breadcrumbs update to show current location
- Active page highlighted in sidebar
**Why human:** Multi-step user flow verification

#### 5. Search Functionality

**Test:** Use search bar, type queries like "scheduling" or "security"
**Expected:**
- Search results appear as you type
- Clicking result navigates to correct page
- Results include relevant modules
**Why human:** Search relevance and interaction testing

**Note:** According to SUMMARY.md, these items were verified during Task 3 human checkpoint and approved by the user.

3. ✓ 10 modules are navigable with proper hierarchical structure in sidebar
4. ✓ Site is deployed and accessible at https://schoolofdevops.github.io/kubernetes-intermediate/ (HTTP 200)
5. ✓ Deployment workflow exists, is syntactically valid, and ran successfully

**Key Evidence:**
- Build succeeds with 65 documents indexed across 2 search indexes
- Deployed site HTML confirms all 10 modules visible in sidebar navigation
- GitHub Actions workflow completed successfully on 2026-02-08T09:43:39Z
- All configuration files are substantive (137+ lines for config), properly wired, and contain no stub patterns
