## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap Structure: Derived 5 core phases from 82 requirements with quick depth calibration, focusing on foundation-first approach to prevent rework
- Phase 6 (Optional): Included v2 automated lab validation as future phase per user instruction, clearly marked as deferred
- Content Grouping: Split 10 course sections into two content phases (Sections 0-4, Sections 5-9) for manageable sprint execution with story consistency
- D001 (01-01): Scaffold Docusaurus in temp directory due to create-docusaurus limitation with existing directories
- D002 (01-01): Explicitly set navbar logo href to '/intro' to fix broken link in docs-only mode where routeBasePath is '/'
