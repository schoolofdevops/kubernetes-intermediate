# Section 1: Pod Scheduling

## Overview

This section covers advanced pod scheduling techniques including node selectors, affinity/anti-affinity, taints, and tolerations.

### Key Concepts

- Node selectors and labels
- Node affinity and anti-affinity rules
- Pod affinity and anti-affinity
- Taints and tolerations for node isolation

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: scheduled-pod
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    disktype: ssd
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
            operator: In
            values:
            - node-1
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.25
```
