# Section 4: Service Mesh

## Overview

This section helps you understand when to adopt a service mesh, comparing solutions like Istio, Linkerd, and Cilium.

### Key Concepts

- Service mesh architecture and use cases
- When to use (and when NOT to use) a service mesh
- Traffic management and observability features
- Comparison of major service mesh solutions

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: vote-app
  annotations:
    sidecar.istio.io/inject: "true"
    traffic.sidecar.istio.io/includeInboundPorts: "80,443"
spec:
  containers:
  - name: vote
    image: schoolofdevops/vote:v1
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```
