<objective>
Create complete Module 0: Introduction and Getting Started - the foundational module that introduces the course narrative ("Production Readiness Journey"), reviews Kubernetes essentials for intermediate learners, sets up a KIND multi-node cluster, deploys the Example Voting App baseline, and establishes the starting state all subsequent modules build upon.

Purpose: Module 0 is the entry point. It sets the tone, provides base YAMLs in examples/, and ensures every learner starts from the same working Voting App deployment. Without this, no later module has a foundation to build on.

Output: Complete Module 0 (overview, reading, lab, quiz) plus examples/ directory with all base Voting App YAMLs and KIND cluster config.

  <files>

    docs/section-0/02-reading.md
  </files>
  <action>
**1. Update docs/section-0/01-overview.mdx:**
Replace the current placeholder content. Keep the existing Mermaid course learning path flowchart. Update the page to serve as a proper module landing page:
- Title: "Module 0: Introduction and Getting Started"
- Add frontmatter: sidebar_position: 1, title: "Overview", description: brief description
- Add metadata block at top: Difficulty: Intermediate, Estimated Time: 90 minutes (15 min reading + 45 min lab + 15 min quiz)
- Keep the Mermaid learning path diagram already there
- Add 2-3 paragraph overview of this module: what learners will do, why it matters
- Add "What You Will Learn" bullet list (4-5 items)
- Add "Prerequisites" section listing K8s Essentials knowledge assumed
- Remove the "Coming Soon" text and placeholder Example YAML

**2. Create docs/section-0/02-reading.md:**
Follow templates/content-template.md structure. Target: 10-15 minute read (~2000-3000 words). Use conversational, friendly tone. No emojis.

Content structure:
- **Overview** (2-3 paragraphs): Introduce the "Production Readiness Journey" narrative. The Example Voting App is a startup's first Kubernetes deployment - it works, but is not production-ready. Over the course, learners will evolve it through scheduling, autoscaling, traffic management, security, and packaging. Frame Module 0 as "establishing the baseline."
- **The Example Voting App** section:
  - Architecture description: 5 components (vote, result, worker, redis, postgres)
  - Communication flow: User -> vote (Python/Flask) -> Redis (queue) -> Worker (.NET) -> Postgres -> Result (Node.js) -> User
  - Include Mermaid architecture diagram showing all 5 components with connections and ports (use Kubernetes blue color conventions from research: classDef k8sBlue fill:#326ce5,stroke:#fff,color:#fff)
  - Explain each component's role in 1-2 sentences
- **Kubernetes Essentials Review** section:
  - Brief review of: Pods, Deployments, Services, Namespaces, Labels/Selectors
  - Keep this concise - learners know this, just refreshing vocabulary
  - Use "you already know..." framing
  - Include a tip admonition: "If any of these feel unfamiliar, consider reviewing the Kubernetes Essentials course first"
- **KIND: Kubernetes IN Docker** section:
  - What KIND is and why we use it (local multi-node clusters, CI/CD friendly, lightweight)
  - Multi-node cluster concept (1 control plane + 3 workers for this course)
  - Include Mermaid diagram: KIND cluster topology (control-plane + 3 worker nodes in Docker containers)
  - Brief mention of alternatives (Minikube, k3s) and why KIND for this course
- **What Makes a Deployment "Production Ready"?** section:
  - List the gaps in a basic deployment: no scheduling control, no autoscaling, no traffic management, no security policies, no packaging
  - Map each gap to a course module (this becomes the motivation for the entire course)
  - Use a caution admonition: "A deployment that works is not the same as a deployment that is production-ready"
- **Summary** with 4-5 bullet points
- **Further Reading** with links to: KIND docs, Example Voting App repo, Kubernetes concepts docs
- Info admonition at end: "Next Steps - You're ready to set up your cluster and deploy the app in the lab"

Voice: Conversational, direct address ("you/we"), simple language, analogies welcome. No emojis per project memory.

  <action>
**1. Create examples/kind-cluster.yaml:**
KIND multi-node cluster config (1 control-plane + 3 workers):
```yaml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
- role: control-plane
- role: worker
- role: worker
- role: worker
```

**2. Create examples/voting-app/ base YAML files:**
Create individual YAML files for each Voting App component. These are the BASELINE (basic, not production-ready - no affinity, no resource requests, no HPA). Use images from research: schoolofdevops/vote:v1 for vote, result, worker components. redis:alpine for redis. postgres:15-alpine for postgres.

Each file should be a clean, minimal Deployment or Service:
- **vote-deployment.yaml**: Deployment with 1 replica, schoolofdevops/vote:v1, containerPort 80
- **vote-service.yaml**: Service type NodePort, port 80, targetPort 80, nodePort 30000 (for easy access)
- **result-deployment.yaml**: Deployment with 1 replica, schoolofdevops/result, containerPort 80
- **result-service.yaml**: Service type NodePort, port 80, targetPort 80, nodePort 30001
- **worker-deployment.yaml**: Deployment with 1 replica, schoolofdevops/worker:latest
- **redis-deployment.yaml**: Deployment with 1 replica, redis:alpine, containerPort 6379
- **redis-service.yaml**: ClusterIP Service, port 6379
- **postgres-deployment.yaml**: Deployment with 1 replica, postgres:15-alpine, env vars POSTGRES_USER=postgres POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres, containerPort 5432
- **postgres-service.yaml**: ClusterIP Service, port 5432

All resources in default namespace (not voting-app namespace - keep it simple for Module 0). All Deployments use labels: app: <component-name>. Services use matching selectors.

NOTE: These are intentionally BASIC. No resource requests/limits, no affinity rules, no health checks. This is the "works but not production-ready" baseline that the course will improve.

**3. Create docs/section-0/03-lab.md:**
Follow templates/lab-template.md 8-section structure. Duration target: 45-60 minutes.

Title: "Lab: Setting Up Your Kubernetes Playground"

- **Objectives** (5 items): Create KIND multi-node cluster, deploy all Voting App components, verify end-to-end application flow, understand component communication, identify baseline limitations
- **Prerequisites**: Docker installed and running, kubectl installed, kind CLI installed, terminal/shell access
- **Setup**: Verify Docker is running (`docker info`), verify kubectl is installed (`kubectl version --client`), verify kind is installed (`kind version`). Include links to install any missing tools.
- **Tasks** (5 tasks + 1 challenge):
  - Task 1: Create KIND multi-node cluster (use examples/kind-cluster.yaml, verify with `kubectl get nodes`, explain control-plane vs worker roles)
  - Task 2: Deploy infrastructure services (apply redis + postgres YAMLs, verify pods running, explain why these go first)
  - Task 3: Deploy application services (apply worker + vote + result YAMLs, verify all pods running)
  - Task 4: Verify end-to-end workflow (port-forward vote service, submit a vote via browser at localhost:30000, port-forward result service, verify vote appears at localhost:30001, check redis queue and postgres data with kubectl exec)
  - Task 5: Explore the baseline (run `kubectl get all`, discuss what is missing: no resource limits, single replicas, no scheduling control, no health checks - connect to course roadmap)
  - Challenge: Break and fix (delete the worker pod, observe votes stop flowing to results, let Deployment recreate it, discuss self-healing)
- **Verification**: kubectl get all shows all pods Running, vote service accepts votes at localhost:30000, result service shows votes at localhost:30001, worker processes votes (redis queue drains to postgres)
- **Cleanup**: Note that we do NOT clean up - Module 1 builds on this. Just note: "Keep your cluster running. Module 1 starts from this exact state."
- **Troubleshooting**: 3 common issues:
  1. KIND cluster creation fails (Docker not running / insufficient resources)
  2. Pods stuck in ImagePullBackOff (image name typo or network issues)
  3. Vote service works but results show zero (worker not running or postgres connection issue)
- **Key Takeaways**: 5 points connecting to production readiness journey

Include all kubectl commands with expected output. Use `title` attribute on YAML code blocks for filenames. Include curl/browser verification steps with expected behavior described.

**4. Create docs/section-0/quiz.md:**
Follow templates/quiz-template.md format. Create 12 questions (mix: 7 MCQ, 3 scenario, 2 true/false).

Topics to cover:
- KIND cluster architecture (multi-node, Docker-based)
- Deployment vs Pod vs ReplicaSet relationship
- Service types (ClusterIP, NodePort) and when to use each
- Example Voting App component roles
- Namespace purpose and default behavior
- Label/selector matching
- Basic kubectl commands (get, describe, apply, delete)
- Self-healing (what happens when a pod is deleted)
- Why baseline deployments are not production-ready

Each question: Question Type, Question text, Options (A/B/C/D for MCQ), Correct Answer, Explanation (2-4 sentences). Scenario questions should reference the Voting App. No trick questions - test understanding and practical application.
