## Overview

Welcome to the Kubernetes Intermediate course. This module establishes the foundation for your production readiness journey. You'll deploy the Example Voting App - a multi-tier microservices application that will serve as your continuous learning environment throughout this course.

Think of Module 0 as setting the baseline. You'll create a local Kubernetes cluster using KIND, deploy all five components of the voting application, and verify it works end-to-end. This deployment works, but it's not production-ready. Over the next nine modules, you'll evolve this basic setup into a robust, scalable, secure production deployment.

By the end of this module, you'll have a working multi-node Kubernetes cluster with the Example Voting App running locally. This exact setup becomes your playground for exploring advanced scheduling, autoscaling, traffic management, security policies, and more.

## What You Will Learn

- Set up a multi-node Kubernetes cluster using KIND (Kubernetes IN Docker)
- Deploy a complete microservices application with five interconnected components
- Understand the architecture and communication flow of the Example Voting App
- Verify end-to-end application functionality across multiple services
- Identify the gaps between "works" and "production-ready" deployments

## Prerequisites

This course assumes you have completed the Kubernetes Essentials course or have equivalent knowledge. You should be comfortable with:

- **Pods:** The smallest deployable units in Kubernetes
- **Deployments:** Managing replica sets and rolling updates
- **Services:** ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer types
- **kubectl:** Basic commands (apply, get, describe, logs, exec)
- **Namespaces:** Organizing and isolating resources
- **Labels and Selectors:** Identifying and grouping resources

If any of these concepts feel unfamiliar, we recommend reviewing the Kubernetes Essentials course before proceeding. This intermediate course builds directly on that foundation.
