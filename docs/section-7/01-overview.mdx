# Module 7: Extending Kubernetes with CRDs

## What You Will Learn

By the end of this module, you will understand:

- How CRDs extend the Kubernetes API to create custom resource types
- Designing a custom resource schema with OpenAPI v3 validation
- Creating and managing custom resources with kubectl
- Status subresources for reporting resource state
- How CRDs set the foundation for Operators (Module 8)

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:

- KIND cluster running
- kubectl installed and configured
- Familiarity with Kubernetes resource model (pods, deployments, services)

## Overview

Every kubectl command you have used so far—`kubectl get pods`, `kubectl get deployments`, `kubectl get services`—works because those resource types are built into the Kubernetes API. But what if you could define your OWN resource types? What if `kubectl get voteconfigs` worked just like `kubectl get pods`? That is exactly what Custom Resource Definitions give you.
