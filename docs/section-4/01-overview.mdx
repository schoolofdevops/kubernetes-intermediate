# Module 4: Service Mesh

## Overview

You've added scheduling, autoscaling, and Gateway API to the Voting App. The next question isn't "how to add a service mesh" - it is "SHOULD you add one?" This module builds your decision-making muscle.

Service mesh is a crossroads decision in production readiness. Many teams adopt it prematurely, adding complexity without benefit. Others add it too late, missing observability and security gaps. This module teaches you when a service mesh adds value versus when it adds unnecessary overhead.

## What You Will Learn

- What service mesh provides (mTLS, observability, traffic management)
- When to adopt a service mesh based on your architecture and team
- Istio vs Linkerd comparison with tradeoffs for each
- Decision framework for mesh adoption with evaluation criteria
- Optional hands-on with Linkerd to see mesh behavior in action

## Metadata

- **Difficulty:** Intermediate-Advanced
- **Estimated Time:** 80 minutes
  - Reading: 15 minutes
  - Lab: 50 minutes (evaluation exercise with optional hands-on)
  - Quiz: 15 minutes

## Prerequisites

- **Modules 0-3 completed** (conceptual understanding of Voting App architecture)
- **kubectl and kind installed** (already have KIND cluster running)
- **This module is evaluation-focused** rather than implementation-focused - you'll build decision-making skills

## Next Steps

Start with the reading materials to understand service mesh concepts and the decision framework, then apply your knowledge in the lab evaluation exercise.
