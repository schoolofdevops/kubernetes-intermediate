# Section 3: Gateway API

## Overview

This section introduces the Kubernetes Gateway API as the next-generation ingress solution with advanced traffic routing.

### Key Concepts

- Gateway API vs Ingress comparison
- HTTPRoute and routing rules
- Traffic splitting and canary deployments
- Gateway controllers and implementations

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: vote-route
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: main-gateway
  hostnames:
  - "vote.example.com"
  rules:
  - matches:
    - path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: /
    backendRefs:
    - name: vote-service
      port: 80
```
